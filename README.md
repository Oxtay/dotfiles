# Dotfile Boilerplate

Easy and sensible defaults to get started with dotfiles

## Quickstart

cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

Follow the prompts

## What's a dotfile?

see: http://dotfiles.github.io/

## Why

This project started with the idea that I would update my current dotfile 
repo's `bootstrap` script. As I started Googling around the web for some 
ideas, I got to thinking -- wouldn't it be great if there were a cannonical 
reference for dotfiles?!

The hope is that this repository can grow and collect great ideas, functions, 
and well-considered dotfiles from interesting discussions and people around 
the internet. 

Beginners will have an amazing starting point and advanced users will have 
a wellspring of ideas.
