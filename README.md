Unified. Organized. Personalized.

## Quickstart

Follow the prompts

## What's a dotfile?

see: http://dotfiles.github.io/

## Why

There is no canonical method for dotfile organization, sharing and bootstraping 
that is cross-shell and cross-system compatible.

This project should work to provide dotfile-beginners with sensible defaults
and advanced users with a powerful, configurable framework on which to build.

## Features

At it&#8217;s core, **Dotfile Boilerplate** is a system for dotfile 
organization more than an opinionated framework.

There are, however, some sensible defaults to help beginners get started.

**Dotfile Boilerplate** heavily "borrows" from many fine dotfile repos
