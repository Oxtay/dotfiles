# Getting Started with Dotfile Boilerplate

## Quick Start

If you don&#8217;t already have a huge collection of dotfiles simply run the 
installer and follow the prompts:

```Shell
git clone git://github.com/thcipriani/dotfile-boilerplate ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

## How it works

`bootstrap` will guide you through the setup of sensible defaults for your system.
All files in the `~/.dotfiles` directory (and any subdirectory that is a direct decentdant 
of `~/.dotfiles` directory) that follow the format `*.symlink` will be symlinked in 
your `$HOME` directory.

```Shell
~/.dotfiles/*/**/basename.symlink â†’ ~/.basename
```

If you&#8217;ve already accumulated a large collection of dotfiles, 
this repository should create a very configurable and portable setup for you.

### Files to tweak

The main files you&#8217;ll want to change are: 

- `~/.dotfiles/shell/aliases.symlink`
- `~/.dotfiles/shell/exports.symlink`
- `~/.dotfiles/shell/functions.symlink`
- `~/.dotfiles/shell/extra.symlink`

and any configuration files for programs that you already have and want to 
keep. Each of those are meant to hold and bash aliases, exported variables, 
unique functions or other configuration respectively.

### Some OSX Configs, Some Linux Configs

In addition to the files in the `~/.dotfiles/shell` directory there are 
system&#8212;specific copies of those all the `shell` files in their respective 
system folders&#8212;`osx` for Macs and `linux` for Linux machines.

The goal is to have a single, unified, dotfile repo for all the systems on which you work.

### Default Configs

By default **Dotfile Boilerplate** includes config files for:

- bash (including `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` and `.bash_prompt`)
- zsh
- vim (both `.vimrc` and `.vim/` directory with Pathogen)
- tmux
- ack
- `.inputrc`

These configurations where amalgamated from various sources which are, largely (hopefully),
indicated in-line in the actual config file.

### Semi-Intelligent

If you already have a `~/.*rc` file for a program **Dotfile Boilerplate**&#8217;s 
`bootstrap` won&#8217;t simply overwrite that file&#8212;you&#8217;ll be 
prompted if you want to `[s]kip` that config, `[b]ackup` that config (saving 
it to `~/.[whatever].backup` OR simply `[o]verwrite` the existing file.

**Dotfile Boilerplate** detects your system type and only is somewhat intelligent 
and will only link items form the `osx` folder if you&#8217;re on a Mac&#8212;likewise
for the `linux` directory on linux.

**Dotfile Boilerplate** also detects shell type and won&#8217;t install anything
from the `zsh` directory if you&#8217;re using bash&#8212;likewise if you&#8217;re
using z-shell it won&#8217;t install anything from the `bash` directory.

### Prompts

As the bootstrap script runs you _may_&#8212;depending on your current configurations&#8212;be
prompted to install some shell frameworks ([Oh-My-ZSH](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) for Z-Shell users
and [Bash-It](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) for Bash users).

If you already have these frameworks installed in their default locations&#8212;**Dotfile Boilerplate**
will proceed with the remainder of the installation without prompting you to
_reinstall_ these frameworks.

In addition to these shell frameworks if your `~/.dotfiles/vim/.vimrc` is LESS 
THAN 10 lines AND you have `curl`, `ack`, `ctags`, `git`, `ruby`, and `rake` in your
`$PATH` you will be prompted to install the [Janus Vim Framework](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
